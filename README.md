# DevHub Application

#### Video Demo: [Watch here](https://youtu.be/BZ5xcTF5dFM)

### Description
DevHub is a portfolio platform where developers can showcase their work by telling the full story behind each project. It goes beyond a simple code repository, allowing users to create detailed case studies complete with video demos, architectural diagrams, and personal reflections on their key learnings.

---

### Distinctiveness and Complexity
DevHub integrates concepts and functionalities from previous CS50 projects into a unified platform designed for portfolio management and professional community engagement. Unlike the Wiki project, DevHub is not a knowledge repository but a structured environment for developers to present their work and technical competencies. In contrast to Mail, its emphasis lies on project presentation rather than communication. Unlike E-commerce, DevHub is not oriented toward transactions but toward professional showcasing. Finally, while it incorporates certain social elements from Network, it does not function as a full-scale social networking site.

From a technical perspective, DevHub demonstrates substantial complexity through the integration of multiple Django models **User**, **Project**, **Review**, and **Technology** which are interconnected using several Many-to-Many relationships to ensure scalability and data consistency. The application also employs custom JavaScript functions. These functions enable asynchronous operations, including project starring, review submission, project deletion, user image updates, visibility toggling, and follow/unfollow interactions, thereby enhancing responsiveness and user experience.
